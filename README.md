# qgis-quickstart

Geospatial data + style in a single file, ready to load and edit in QGIS.

These are from my personal working files and I'm making them available AS IS (bugs and all).

## Set Up

Download and install QGIS if you don't already have it: [QGIS Downloads](https://qgis.org/download/).

### Browser Panel

Add a useful browser panel to navigate and load files:

`View` > `Panel` > `Browser`

### Loading Files

Load a GPKG file by navigating to the downloaded file in the `Browser Panel`, double-click to expand the layer(s) saved in the file, select the layer(s) you want and drag them to the `Layer Panel` or right-click and select `Add Layer to Project`.
